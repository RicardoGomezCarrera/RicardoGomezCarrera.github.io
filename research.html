                    <div class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic has caused both supply and demand shocks, but their relative importance has varied over time and across sectors. Using a sign-restricted structural Bayesian VAR, this paper studies how supply and demand factors shaped sectoral economic activity and prices in Mexico during the pandemic. We find that during the peak contraction in 2020 Q2, domestic demand shocks were the dominant driver of fluctuations across most sectors. External demand, external supply, and exchange rate shocks also played important roles in explaining GDP movements. Since early 2021, external supply shocks have contributed negatively to industrial production and several other sectors, while domestic and foreign demand have generally supported the recovery.</div>

This study evaluates the impact of Mexico's preschool mandate on primary school performance using a staggered difference in differences design. The reform increased Grade 5 test scores by 0.05 to 0.16 standard deviations but also widened gaps between highly and weakly marginalized localities. Smaller preschool groups and longer attendance improved cognitive outcomes despite a higher share of low skilled teachers. The results highlight the importance of targeting quality improvements when expanding early childhood education.</div>

                    <div class="abstract">Mexico introduced a nationwide preschool mandate in 2002 requiring three years of preschool before primary school. Using administrative education records, household survey data, and a regression discontinuity design, this paper estimates medium and long run effects of the reform. The mandate increased math and Spanish test scores in fifth and sixth grade, improved noncognitive skills and student engagement, reduced grade repetition, and raised educational attainment among young adults almost twenty years later. The findings show that high quality universal preschool can generate persistent benefits over the life cycle.</div>

Exploiting a sharp discontinuity in the program's initial rollout, we estimate a 12 percent increase in outpatient visits to public clinics, driven mainly by children and adults aged 20 to 49. The program improved reproductive health services and chronic disease screening but also increased congestion and reduced self reported quality of care for non beneficiaries. These results show that large scale preventive health policies can generate both important benefits and unintended costs.</div>

We proceed with some simple results on the world's richest and poorest countries in 2023, and finally with the global structure of foreign wealth, foreign income, and trade balance of the 1970-2023 period and with the evolution of public revenue and public spending at the global level during 1980-2023.</div>

                    <div class="abstract">This study examines the evolution of labor force participation in Mexico since 2005, with a particular focus on differences by sex and age groups. While aggregate participation has remained relatively stable over the period, this stability masks substantial heterogeneity across population groups. Using an econometric model in which participation rates are expressed as a function of key individual and household characteristics, the analysis documents a declining trend in male participation, driven primarily by lower participation among young and older workers. Female participation, although still significantly lower than male participation, exhibits an upward long-run trend that reflects strong generational effects, as successive cohorts of women display higher propensities to participate in the labor market. The results also highlight the role of rising educational attainment and increased scholarship coverage in shaping participation patterns, particularly through delayed labor market entry among younger individuals. Although this has temporarily reduced participation among the youngest age group, the findings suggest positive long-term implications for labor market attachment and productivity.</div>

The reform raised test scores by about 0.04 standard deviations four years after implementation through a 2 percentage point increase in preschool enrollment. These gains persisted through the end of elementary school and were similar for girls and boys. The policy increased the share of high skilled teachers while keeping student teacher ratios constant. Mandatory preschool can therefore improve learning outcomes with lasting effects.</div>

A difference in differences design using Ecobici bikesharing data shows that trips increased by 4 to 7 per hour during the shortage and remained elevated in the months that followed. One month after the shock, Ecobici usage was still 7 trips per hour higher, and after three to five months it remained 3 trips per hour higher. The results indicate that bicycles are a partial and persistent substitute for automobiles in areas covered by the bikesharing system.</div>
